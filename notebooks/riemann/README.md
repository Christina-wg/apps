Riemann solver notebooks
========================

These are currently broken.  Need to update to latest Jupyter and ipywidgets.

Better versions of these notebooks and others can now be found in
    https://github.com/clawpack/riemann_book
developed for the book
    Riemann Problems and Jupyter Solutions
    Theory and Approximate Solvers for Hyperbolic PDEs
    by David I. Ketcheson, Randall J. LeVeque, and Mauricio J. del Razo
to be published by SIAM in 2020.

For rendered html versions of the notebooks and other related links, see
