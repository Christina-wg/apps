    "The adage \"know enough to be dangerous\" is more true here than we would like to admit.  If you do not know how to interpret your results you may be lead to false conclusions.  At the most basic you should understand that you are solving fluid flow governed by mass conservation and Newton's second law (momentum conservation with external forces).  It is also probably important to know that the *finite volume* method you are using is conservative when necessary. Check out the references below if you want more technical details on the equations, their derivation, and the methods used to solve these equations."

Generally this is an array with components `[h, hu, hv]`, depth, momentum in the longitudinal and latitudinal directions respectively.  One quirk to watch for is that in the output there is an extra array element added on that gives the sea-surface `eta`.  This is done so that the results are easy to plot and the bathymetry/topography is easy to calculate.\n",
